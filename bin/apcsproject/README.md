# Welcome to UnitControl!
A game built by Alexander Ng in Java. This game is a Sandbox RTS-Styled game.


__How it works__
In this game, you have Units and Buildings. You start off with one Base in the middle, which is a type of building that spawns units. CLick on it to select it, and watch the console for information on that object. Once you spawn some units, you can use them to spawn more buildings around your original Base. Click on a Unit to get options. You can also Group Select a bunch of Units, by clicking somewhere, then holding down and dragging to release somewhere else. Any selected units will show up with a white indicator. Once you have them selected, you can attack somewhere by moving your mouse and pressing space, upon which all selected units will go to that specific spot.
